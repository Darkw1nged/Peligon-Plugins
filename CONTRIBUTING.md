## :beetle: 1. Issues: Bug Reports
One of the foundations for good software is reliability. To facilitate this reliability, our community must work together to crush bugs that arise. 
This of course requires good information and knowledge about ongoing bugs and issues though.

If you encounter an issue which has already been reported, please don't open a new one.<br>
It would be awesome though if you could post a comment on the existing issue which explains how you were able to reproduce this yourself.
The more context and information we get, the easier we can fix it.

## :earth_africa: 4. Pull Requests: Translations
Another great way to contribute to the prokect is by working on translations for the project.
Peligon Plugins' translation is available on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/peligon-plugins).
Just find a language you are fluent in and translate away. But make sure to submit a "Review Request" when you are done.
One of our Language Moderators will review the changes and submit a Pull Request to the project for you.

#### Language Moderation
Very active community translators will have the option to become a "Language Moderator". 
Language Moderators are responsible for proof-reading any new translations for their designated language and correct it when they see a mistake.

For more info on how or what to translate, check out our article on [How to translate the Peligon Project](https://github.com/Darkw1nged/Peligon-Plugins/wiki/Translating-Peligon-Plugins).

## :scroll: 5. Pull Requests: Wiki contributions
Peligon Plugins will become large project with a wide range of different plugins and might be quite intimidating for new users.
That's why good documentation is always nice and helpful.
If you have used any of the plugins for a while and gotten yourself familiar with how things work, please consider contributing your experiences and knowledge to others via the wiki!
It would help out a lot :heart:
